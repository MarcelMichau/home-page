### An attempt at a portfolio site

_"Hey, you should create a portfolio website! It's good for your personal brand and can really help get your name out there." - Some guy_

I am a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa.

I have a passion for creating things, and experimenting while doing so.

P.S. This was previously some fancy over-engineered site, but I've since started valuing simplicity more. Plus the hosting was expensive. :)
